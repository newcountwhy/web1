                                <p>Lake Untersee (German: Untersee, "Lower Lake") is the largest surface 
                                    freshwater lake in the interior of the Gruber Mountains of central Queen M
                                    aud Land in East Antarctica. It is situated 90 kilometres (56 mi) to the 
                                    southwest of the Schirmacher Oasis. The lake is approximately 6.5 kilometres 
                                    (4.0 mi) long and 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) wide, with a surface area of 11.4 
                                    square kilometres (4.4 sq mi), and a maximum depth of 169 metres (554 ft). 
                                    The lake is permanently covered with ice and is partly bounded by glacier ice</p>
                                <p>Lake Untersee is an unusual lake, with pH between 9.8 and 12.1,
                                    dissolved oxygen at 150 percent supersaturation, and very low primary production in 
                                    the water column. Despite the high oxygen supersaturation in most of the lake, there is 
                                    a small sub-basin at the southern end that is anoxic and its sediments may have a higher 
                                    methane concentration than those of any other known lake on Earth.[4][5] Much of the primary 
                                    production is in microbial communities that grow on the floor of the lake as stromatolites.
                                     The water temperature varies between 0.5 °C (32.9 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) and the ice cover on 
                                     the lake is 2–6 metres (6.6–19.7 ft) thick. The ice cover may have persisted 
                                     for over 100,000 years, and some scientists studying climate change fear significant 
                                     environmental changes associated with global warming in the coming decades. In the past, the 
                                     water chemistry of the lake has been compared to Clorox. However, the chemical activity 
                                     of bleach is due to Cl− in addition to a pH that is higher than that measures in Lake Untersee, 
                                     and Lake Untersee does not have high chlorine or chlorite concentrations.</p>

                                "The lake has been ice-covered for at least 15 million years," said Brent Christner, a Louisiana State University biologist who has examined ice cores collected above the lake.
                                </blockquote>

                                <p>Isotope studies have established that the lake has long had 
                                    a permanent ice cover. Further, studies carried out during the 
                                    austral summer confirm the lake's homogeneous characteristics, 
                                    with thermal convection as the reason given for its hydro-geochemical 
                                    and isotropical nature. It is replenished perennially by a process of u
                                    nderwater melting of the adjacent glacier ice. It is also stated that 
                                    the lake existed during the Holocene period when it emerged from a 
                                    melt-water pond.</p>
                                    

                                        

                                <p>Studies of Lake Untersee have revealed that there are several large boulders 
                                    which dam the lake. Geodetic studies carried out during two summer seasons 
                                    indicated that the boulders move at an annual rate of 1.1–3.9 metres (3.6–12.8 ft). 
                                    Residence time of the boulders has been estimated as 500 years. The floating 
                                    boulders, which are several metres in diameter, have evolved as result of debris 
                                    deposits from pro-glacial interaction, mass wasting from hills surrounding the 
                                    lake and the displacement of glacial ice by lake ice.
                                    </p>

                                <p>The lake was first discovered by the German Antarctic Expedition of 1938–39. 
                                    After that, several expeditions have studied the lake's characteristics. The first 
                                    reconnaissance study of the lake was carried out by N. G. Kosenko and D. D. Kolobov 
                                    in early 1969, followed by more studies by Russian and German scientists, namely by 
                                    W. D. Hermichen et al. (1985), E. Kaup et al. (1988) and A. Loopmann et al</p>

                                    Maud Land in East Antarctica, which is roughly on the same longitude as Huab, 
                                    in the Skeleton Coast National Park on the northern coast of Namibia. It is situated 
                                    90 kilometres (56 mi) to the southwest of the Schirmacher Oasis.
                                    Aurkjosen Cirque lies at the east side of the lake.</p>

                                        

                                <p>The lake is approximately 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) long and 2.5 kilometres 
                                    (1.6 mi) wide and has a surface area of 11.4 square kilometres (4.4 sq mi) (10 square 
                                    kilometres (3.9 sq mi) is also reported). Its maximum depth is 169 metres (554 ft). 
                                    It is permanently covered with ice, which has an average thickness of 3 metres (9.8 ft) 
                                    in summer. The lake is dammed by the Anuchin Glacier, and meltwater 
                                    from the Anuchin Glacier is the main source of water. The lake has no outlet. Water 
                                    is lost through sublimation and ablation of the ice cover. The lake is categorized as an 
                                    ultra-oligotrophic lake.
                                    </p>
